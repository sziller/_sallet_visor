== The Sallet ecosystem
*Sallet* stands as a fortified *Bitcoin wallet ecosystem*, designed for seasoned users seeking paramount *security*
and *full autonomy*. Its low-level architecture empowers users with granular control over Bitcoin transactions, ensuring
multi-layered security measures. This platform offers diverse avenues for leveraging fundamental Bitcoin
functionalities, catering to advanced users' need for heightened sovereignty over their assets.
*Sallet* allows users to issue their own *NFT*'s over Bitcoin. It also trackS Users NFT balance across the spectrum
of issued tokens. While offering means to trace the entirety of their issued NFT's, users gain comprehensive control
over their NFT ecosystem.

=== Modules in the *Sallet system*
- *Sallet Visor* - Handles public-only data, serving as a world-facing online Secure Wallet App.
- *Sallet Head* - An air-gapped unit for transaction signing and key management on dedicated, fully self-custodied
hardware.
- *Sallet Neck* - (as of now part of Visor) Manages token issuance and tracking for self-issued Tokens and NFTs.

=== Security Design
*Sallet* prioritizes robust security measures against potential threats.
The development approach explicitly assumes an environment compromised not only by malicious software but also
by zero-day compromised hardware. To address security concerns, *Sallet* employs:

==== Air-Gapped Setup
- Private keys are generated and stored offline.
- Signatures are generated in an airgapped environment.
- Custom-made analogue entropy is an option for users.

==== Data Handling
- Transactions are signed on the airgapped HEAD device.
- Data transfer from the HEAD unit to the world-facing VISOR module occurs via analogue means.
- Zero-knowledge tests regularly check for irregularities caused by malicious code or compromised hardware components.

[TIP]
====
This design ensures a resilient security setup, even in an adversarial environment, by strictly controlling data flow
and continuously verifying against threats posed by software vulnerabilities and potentially compromised hardware elements.

=== Visuals and Whitelabeling
Utilizing Kivy, our framework enables effortless customization of layout, colors, images, fonts, and widget appearance.
Developers unfamiliar with Python can easily redesign the app by manipulating the .ky file, akin to styling with CSS. 
This flexibility extends to saving multiple layouts within the app, offering a seamless choice at program launch.
Additionally, this streamlined process encompasses whitelabeling tasks.

== *Sallet VISOR*: Secure Wallet Module
*Sallet Visor* is a module within the *Sallet system*, developed by Sziller and Team at _sziller.eu_.
The actual wallet application of the Sallet ecosystem.
