= Sallet Visor: Extreme Secure Wallet Module

*Sallet Visor* is a module within the *Sallet system*, developed by Sziller and Team at _sziller.eu_.
It serves as an advanced, low-level Bitcoin wallet that exclusively manages public data.
Designed with extreme security in mind, Visor offers:

== Key Features
- Coin selection
- Direct node support
- 3rd party node selection
- Token management
- ... and is the gateway to the airgapped HEAD unit

== Platform Support
Visor is currently under development for Linux OS and Android Mobiles,
with plans to expand to other platforms in the future.

== Security Design
Sallet prioritizes robust security measures against potential threats.
The development approach explicitly assumes an environment compromised not only by malicious software but also
by zero-day compromised hardware. To address security concerns, Sallet employs:

=== Air-Gapped Setup
- Private keys are generated and stored offline.
- Signatures are generated in an airgapped environment.
- Custom-made analogue entropy is an option for users.

=== Data Handling
- Transactions are signed on the airgapped HEAD device.
- Data transfer from the HEAD unit to the world-facing VISOR module occurs via analogue means.
- Zero-knowledge tests regularly check for irregularities caused by malicious code or compromised hardware components.

== Modules in the *Sallet system*
- *Sallet Visor:* Handles public-only data, serving as a world-facing online Secure Wallet App.
- *Sallet Head:* An air-gapped unit for transaction signing and key management on dedicated, fully self-custodied hardware.
- *Sallet Neck:* Manages token issuance and tracking for self-issued Tokens and NFTs.

[TIP]
====
This design ensures a resilient security setup, even in an adversarial environment, by strictly controlling data flow
and continuously verifying against threats posed by software vulnerabilities and potentially compromised hardware elements.
